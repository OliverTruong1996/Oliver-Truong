    Hi everyone! I'm a senior at the Unviversity of Georiga and I enjoy writing in my free time. This website is about my journey on Quora and all of my storeis.
    <br> <br>
    This website will help put all of my answers into one place and allow you to learn a little more about myself.
    <br> <br>
    After writing on Quora for a bit, I realized that I wanted to have a place where I am able to place my answers in a format that I wanted. 
    <br> <br>
    I have always wanted to create my own blog or website but I never got around to it until recently. 
    <br> <br>
    If you have read through some of my answers then you might notice a common theme of doing a little everyday.
    <br> <br>
    I understand that this is a common cliche that most people know but have you ever gone out of the way to do this?
    <br> <br>
    I always knew this but it wasn't until I started to actually take the time to constantly incoporate this into my everyday life.
    <br> <br>
    I started with simple habits such as reading 10 pages of a book everday or doing 10 pushups a day.
    <br> <br>
    These habits eventually lead me to writing one answer on Quora everyday which is how I started my jounrey on Qoura.
    <br> <br>
    When I first started this habit I did not think too much of it.
    <br> <br>
    I wanted to prove to myself that I could accomplish this goal but I now realize just how rewarding this jounrey has been for me.
    <br> <br>
    I have now completed goals that I never gave a second thought to.
