<h1 class = "about"> Why I started this journey</h1>
    
    
    <p class = "summer"> 
    I started using Quora in the summer of 2017
    <br> <br>
    I wanted to improve my writing so I thought what better way then to answer Quora questions.
    <br> <br>
    At this time I had been using Quora for quite a while but I never wanted to answer questions because I always thought my writing was never good enough.
    <br> <br>
    When I first started I never thought I would end up where I am now.   
    <br> <br>
    My initial goal was to improve my writing and nothing more.
    <br> <br>
    I wanted to build a habit that was outside of my comfort zone and I wanted to prove to myself that I could do it.
    <br> <br>
    What started out as a simple challenge became much more and I am so glad I pushed myself.
