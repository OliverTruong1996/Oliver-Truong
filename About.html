<h1 class = "about"> Why I started this journey</h1>
    
    
     <p class = "summer"> 
    I started using Quora in the summer of 2017
    <br> <br>
    I wanted to improve my writing so I thought what better way then to answer Quora questions.
    <br> <br>
    At this time I had been using Quora for quite a while but I never wanted to answer questions because I always thought my writing was never good enough.
    <br> <br>
    When I first started I never thought I would end up where I am now.   
    <br> <br>
    My initial goal was to improve my writing and nothing more.
    <br> <br>
    I wanted to build a habit that was outside of my comfort zone and I wanted to prove to myself that I could do it.
    <br> <br>
    What started out as a simple challenge became much more.
    <br> <br>
    Through this journey I have been able to meet people from around the world and learn many new ideas from them.    
    <br> <br>
    I have learned about everything from the best books to read to what habits the most successful people have. 
    <br> <br>
    Quora has allowed me to continue my goal of constant learning and more.
    <br> <br>
    From Quora I have been able to have my writing viewed from all around the world.    
    <br> <br>
    I am in the process of having a piece of my writing published.
    <br> <br>
    I have been able to write out my thoughts where thousands of people will be able to read them.    
    <br> <br>
    This all started with the simple act of answering one question.
    <br> <br>
    It didn't happen over night. It didn't happen over a couple of months.
    <br> <br>
    It took just a little everyday and that is what I want my readers to understand.      
    <br> <br>
    Everywhere I look it seems that everyone is looking to change overnight. 
    <br> <br>
    No body wants to put in the work to get the results.    
    <br> <br>
    Everyone wants to lose 20 pounds in two weeks or learn a new skill in a couple of days.
    <br> <br>
    Once people do not see results in a couple of days they give up and this mentality is a result of world we live in.
    <br> <br>
    People have seemed to forget that a little everyday can go a long way.
    <br> <br>
    Once I understood that I should focus on making progress everyday rather than just the result everything changed for me.
    <br> <br>
    I became happier that I was accomplishing my daily goals and I was confident I would reach my long term goals later.
    <br> <br>    
   This method works for me since I am able to recieve feedback daily it pushes me to keep going. 
   <br> <br>
   I can tell by the end of the day whether or not I have done enough for that day.      
   <br> <br>
   For example, I started using Duolingo for Chinese for about 15 mintues everday.       
   <br> <br>
   Even though it's only 15 mintues a day I have been using this app for a couple of months and I have noticed how much more confident I am in speaking and understanding Chinese.      
    <br> <br>
   Once again, I focus on completing the daily goals and the long term goals will eventually be reached.
