<h5> What can I learn right now in 30 mintues that will be useful for the rest of my life?</h5>
    <p>Learn how to juggle </p>
    <p class = "juggle"> I know you’re probably wondering how is juggling going to be useful? <br> 
        That’s what I kept asking myself whenever I would see my friend juggle. <br> 
        I would watch him in awe as he would not only juggle but displaying his athletic ability he would also perform different types of tricks. <br> 
        I always thought to myself that I would never be able to learn how to juggle let alone do any fancy tricks. <br> 
        I was never good at learning new skills so I thought why would this be any different? <br> 
        After this continued for some weeks, I told him that I was determined to learn how to juggle. <br> 
        He taught me the basics but I still struggled and my desire to give up only grew with every ball I dropped. <br> 
        However, something was different that day.<br> 
        I was not only determined but I told myself I was not going to quit until I understood the basics.<br> 
        After two hours of failed attempts, I was able to get the hang of it and not only did I surprise my friend but also myself.<br> 
        Many people want to learn how to juggle to possess some sort of party trick but I realized I enjoyed juggling for a different reason.<br> 
        Before that day, I had always thought I would never be able to learn no matter how much time I spent practicing.<br> 
        Before I even tried, I possessed this mental barrier which only made it more difficult to learn.<br> 
        I realized that I did this throughout many areas of my life.<br> 
        I always thought I would never be able to be the most intelligent kid in my class or I could never be the most athletic.<br> 
        I constantly had to overcome this mental obstacle I placed on myself and this was a major reason why I would stay confined within my comfort zone.<br> 
        Learning how to juggle not only taught me a useful skill but also it made me realize that the mental barrier was self imposed.<br> 
        I realized that I needed to stop limiting myself and all thanks to juggling.<br> 
        I have now taught my friends how to juggle and some have learned in less then 10 minutes.<br> 
        Give it a shot you might just surprise yourself.</p>
