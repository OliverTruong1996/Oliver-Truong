<h5 class="q1"> What can I learn right now in 30 mintues that will be useful for the rest of my life?</h5>
    <p class="q2">Learn how to juggle </p>
    <p class = "q3"> I know you’re probably wondering how is juggling going to be useful? <br> 
        That’s what I kept asking myself whenever I would see my friend juggle. <br> 
        I would watch him in awe as he would not only juggle but displaying his athletic ability he would also perform different types of tricks. <br> 
        I always thought to myself that I would never be able to learn how to juggle let alone do any fancy tricks. <br> 
        I was never good at learning new skills so I thought why would this be any different? <br> 
        After this continued for some weeks, I told him that I was determined to learn how to juggle. <br> 
        He taught me the basics but I still struggled and my desire to give up only grew with every ball I dropped. <br> 
        However, something was different that day.<br> 
        I was not only determined but I told myself I was not going to quit until I understood the basics.<br> 
        After two hours of failed attempts, I was able to get the hang of it and not only did I surprise my friend but also myself.<br> 
        Many people want to learn how to juggle to possess some sort of party trick but I realized I enjoyed juggling for a different reason.<br> 
        Before that day, I had always thought I would never be able to learn no matter how much time I spent practicing.<br> 
        Before I even tried, I possessed this mental barrier which only made it more difficult to learn.<br> 
        I realized that I did this throughout many areas of my life.<br> 
        I always thought I would never be able to be the most intelligent kid in my class or I could never be the most athletic.<br> 
        I constantly had to overcome this mental obstacle I placed on myself and this was a major reason why I would stay confined within my comfort zone.<br> 
        Learning how to juggle not only taught me a useful skill but also it made me realize that the mental barrier was self imposed.<br> 
        I realized that I needed to stop limiting myself and all thanks to juggling.<br> 
        I have now taught my friends how to juggle and some have learned in less then 10 minutes.<br> 
        Give it a shot you might just surprise yourself.</p>

    <h5 class = "q1"> What I can do to better myself in one month? </h5>
    <p class = "q2">Take Cold Showers</p>
    <p class = "q3">
    I know I know why would you ever take cold showers? <br> You are probably wondering how cold showers can transform your life.<br> You have probably heard about the physical benefits such as clearer skin and feeling more energized. <br>While many people take cold showers for the physical benefit I take cold showers for another reason.<br>

    When you first hear of the idea of taking cold showers what is the first thought that comes to mind. <br>If you were anything like me then it was probably how painful it is to take a cold shower right?<br> I don't blame you because cold showers are uncomfortable. <br>What I am trying to say is that once you are able to put yourself in a uncomfortable situation everyday this starts affecting other areas of your life.<br>

    Imagine how much discipline it requires to get up in the morning and hop into a cold shower.<br> On the first day you are going to wonder why you are even trying this. <br>By the end of the first week, you are going to wonder if it is even worth it. <br>By the end of the month, you are going to ask yourself why you didn't start this habit earlier. <br>Once you master that discipline you will start using it throughout your life.<br>

    Once I started this habit I started to ask myself “If I can’t be in an uncomfortable situation for a few minutes a day then how will I ever accomplish my goal of starting my own business?” <br>After taking cold showers for a month, I started approaching my life a little differently.<br> I started to achieve my other goals in life because the reasons that were holding me back were mental barriers I created for myself just like taking cold showers. <br>I started writing on Quora almost everyday and started going to the gym.<br>

    I challenge you to take cold showers for a week and see how it affects your mindset. Who knows by the end of the month you might surprise yourself.
